Feature: An SQL Injection attack with Gauntlt Webgoat Vuln. is broken, so I am returning user credit card numbers
	Scenario:
		When I launch a "generic" attack with:
			"""
			python /home/hacker/test-gauntlt/injection-test/sql-injection2.py
			"""
		Then the output should contain:
			"""
			This is a test to ensure failure
			"""
